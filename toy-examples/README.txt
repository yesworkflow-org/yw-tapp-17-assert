Playground for Bertram's logic rules over (YW) graphs and Graphviz renderings thereof.

Using Bertram's toys (currently: swi-prolog & dlv).

(Useful stuff will be incorporated into the "standard" YW tech stack as needed..)


- covering relation (reduce transitive edges)
- delta between two relations
- "meta" eqv rules, i.e., defining eqv(R) for any R(X,Y)
